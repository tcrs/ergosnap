# ErgoSnap Keyboard

[ErgoDash][1] layout with [Mitosis][2] style PCB construction, reversible ProMicro
chin from [Ergo42][3].

 - Removed all the wiring for backlight/underlight LEDs
 - Uses through-switch diode holes
 - M6 mouting holes on the "inside" board edges for tenting
 - 5 pin connector for [trackball module][4] (no software yet...)
